# Hello over there!
this calculator isn't anything special, it's written in C++, the numbers are doubles and a char for the operation symbol...
Bye and see you to the next project!

Planning to add some area calculators, this shouldnt take long...
nvm it is taking long, but i have implemented 8 shapes :D
